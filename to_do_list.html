__X__Application loads as an HTML file with only one DOM load with everything else being done as a result of client-side programming.
__X__Retrieve and incorporate information from at least one endpoint in the API in the interface.
__X__ (we are filtering as we type) At least one interactive feature in your interface that dynamically alters / updates the interface as a result of some user initiated action.
__X__At least use CSS (either rolled your own or from a framework), regardless of whether design is particularly good.
 

Guidelines for what would get a reasonable (B or better) grade:

All of the above.
__x__ (To, from, and add airline as dropdown) Retrieve and incorporate information from at least three endpoints in the API.
__x__ Add an airline dropdown to satisfy the above requirement. 
____(add a rating option for a flight that posts to the API) Create and update information on the backend to at least one endpoint in the API.
__X__(Tian already did great) Use CSS effectively (i.e., application looks / feels nice to use). CSS frameworks OK.
 

Guidelines for what would get a good (A- or better) grade:

All of the above.
____Create and update information on the backend to at least three endpoints in the API.
__X__ (filter as we type) At least one live interactive feature. By this, I mean that the interface updates somehow as the user is doing something like typing, moving a slider or something like that (autocomplete, live update of list or visualization, etc.).
____ (Leaflet map is a 3rd party API) Incorporating one or more third party APIs (Google Maps is an obvious one, Twitter?, Facebook?, SoundCloud?).
____(Not sure what we'll do for this) Application has more than one "mode" (i.e., the interface gets torn down and rebuilt).
_x___ (Again, props Tian) Excellent design using a framework, or reasonable design rolling your own from scratch CSS. -->
